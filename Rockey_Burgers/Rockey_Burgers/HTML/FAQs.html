        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo1">Why is your Rockey Burger So Expensive?</button>
        <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
            <p>We focus on making meals with the best and freshest ingredients, like
            humanely-raised beef that is ground fresh each day, organic chicken,
            and Rockey Family Dairy’s organic cream for our ice cream cones,
            sundaes and shakes.</p>
            <p>Our commitment to freshness and quality means higher prices than
            you’d find at traditional fast-food burger chains. It also means food
            that tastes way better — because, well, it is.</p>

        <div id="demo2" class="collapse">
            <p class="nomar">We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local,
            family-owned ranches. We use an 85% to 15% protein to fat blend, a
            mixture of the lean protein and the marbling found on in a cut of steak
            for our ground beef. The mixture is ground daily, and thus, our
            burgers taste so amazing.</p>
